It was about taking the “Whole Game Plan” about machine learning and applying it to the CAMELS data-set we have used in prior labs.\nThe concept I am most proud of learning was how to properly clean data and split it to then create a recipe that actually works! From there the re-sampling and the three candidate models was pretty straight forward for me. I really enjoy using the Random forests and Boosted trees models."
