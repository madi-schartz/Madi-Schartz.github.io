In the Spring of 2025 I took the course ESS 330 Quantitative Reasoning class based in R. I learned how to use RStudio and GitHub to code projects like this one! Scroll down to explore my other projects I did throughout the semester.

## [My GitHub Repo for Building this Website](https://github.com/madi-schartz/Madi-Schartz.github.io)

-   In this assignment we built a static users site with Github Pages

-   I learned how to fork pages from Mikes GitHub account to mine to be able to use in this project.

-   I gained the skills of using qmd and yml files to organize content for the webpage I created.

-   I learned how to maintain workflows using Quarto and GitHub in a way that can communicate several documents.

-   I learned how to write in Quarto and in code to create a cohesive website.

-   I gained confidence in my technical skills. I would have never thought I would be able to produce a working website with so many moving parts!

## [Lab 3: COVID-19](https://madi-schartz.github.io/csu-ess-lab3/lab-03.html)

-   I learned how the ability to have access to open data is extremely important for equitable exposure within environmental science.

-   I got to practice my data wrangling skills using a real-world data-set about COVID cases through the New York Times. 

## [Lab 4: Statistics in R](https://madi-schartz.github.io/Lab-4-LTER-Network-Data/docs/lab4.html)

-   I got to practice my skills using coding to run through basic statistical tests in like chi-square, t-tests, and correlation tests. 

-   We were given examples from our assignment instructions that helped me reproduce the same statistical tests on the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network data sets. 

## [Lab 6: ML Workflows](https://madi-schartz.github.io/Lab6/lab6.html)

-   This is the lab where I was introduced to the tidymodels package, meant for predictive modeling, which was so helpful!

-   I got to go through the coding process of doing an exploratory data analysis on our CAMELS data-set to see how mean stream flow looks across a map of the United States.

-   I have taken a GIS course so this lab felt like a connection of my background knowledge of GIS and now learning new skills in coding within R Studio which was a lot of fun!

## Look at how high quality my work is and how far my progress throughout the semester has gone!
