In the Spring of 2025 I took the course ESS 330 Quantitative Reasoning class based in R. I learned how to use RStudio and GitHub to code projects like this one!

## [My GitHub Repo for Building this Website](https://github.com/madi-schartz/Madi-Schartz.github.io)

-   In this assignment we built a static users site with Github Pages

-   I learned how to fork pages from Mikes GitHub account to mine to be able to use in this project.

-   I gained the skills of using qmd and yml files to organize content for the webpage I created.

-   I learned how to write in Quarto and in code to create a cohesive website.

    ## Look at how high quality my work is!
